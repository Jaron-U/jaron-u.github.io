Hi ðŸ‘‹,  
My name is Jianglong Yu(Jaron). recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Oregon State University. I will soon be embarking on my journey as a graduate student at TAMU, specializing in AI within the field of Computer Science. Currently, I am actively seeking internship opportunities for the summer of 2024.  

##  Research
- **GIS Tool â€“ Safer-Ways**  
  *Mentor: [Professor. Joseph Louis](https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/louis/about)*
  - Developed Safer-Ways, an app for optimal route calculation while avoiding hazards.
  - Created user-friendly interfaces using ArcGIS Pro and open-source routing software.
  - Contributed to the project's backend and frontend using Flask framework and JavaScript.
  - Implemented functionality to avoid wildfires, floods, and degraded infrastructure.
  - Designed complex route aggregation operations for evaluating evacuation points.


- **Development a Supply Chain Model**  
  *Mentor: [Professor. Karthika Mohan](http://www.karthikamohan.com/)*  
  - Building a supply chain model using the Probabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs) in order to answer causal queries.
  - Collect relevant data and generate values of different parameters in the supply chain using different probability distributions, and then answer the causal queries through the model.
