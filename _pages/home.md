Hi ðŸ‘‹,
My name is Jianglong Yu(Jaron). I am a senior at Oregon State University. My major is Computer Science and my area of concentration is Artificial Intelligence.  

I am currently working as a teaching assistant for the CS290 Web Development course.  
## Ongoing Project  
- GIS Disaster Recovery Tools  
  - Aimed to simulate the damage of different buildings after an earthquake to help users take a series of precautions before the earthquake occurs. 
  - This is my Capstone project. I am currently responsible for using the code to obtain the relevant data so that the program can use it for simulation calculations.

- Development a Supply Chain Model based on BLOG
  - Building a model based on probabilities and making predictions for uncertain events.
